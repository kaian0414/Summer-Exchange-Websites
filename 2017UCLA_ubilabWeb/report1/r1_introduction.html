	<font>1.1 Overview</font>
	<p>We took part in an exchange program which conducted by UCLA and MPI this summer. Our project is a mobile chatting app which was developed through Android Studio. As we know, many people are using chatting app to communicate with others instead of using traditional messages. It means that chatting app is a very important tool for communicating nowadays. Therefore, we set up an chatting app from scratch. By doing this, we tried to run the GRPC demo and changed the java client into Android system. We produced a client application program and testing on an android phone. Then we configured the server and made the connection between client and server. We also designed the UI interface of the app and made it as similar as general chatting app. After finishing the basic steps, we also tried our best to modify some minutiae in order to make the app perfectly.</p>

	<p>Android Strong Typed Communication application is developed based on the client-server architecture. Clients and servers exchange messages in a request-response messaging pattern. The client sends a request, and the server returns a response.</p>
	<p>We use Android Studio to develop an android app, called simple chat. The communication used by the app is strong typed, with help of gRPC library, different from traditional http or socket communication. We also use Java language to develop a server.</p>
	<p>Witt suggest us to use a version control tool to save and propagate source code because version control is widely used in not only IT companies, but also personal developments. We chose GIT because it is a de facto standard in version control. We learned we can change files and commit to local repository, and if we want to share the changes with team members, we can push to remote repository, ie. Github, then they will pull the changes to their local. In this way, we avoid transfering code through USB drive and we don't have to back up the code by making a copy of the folder.</p>
