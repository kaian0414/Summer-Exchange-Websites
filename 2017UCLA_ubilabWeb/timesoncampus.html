	<p>We were working in Ubilab around one week. During the time, Professor Giovanni Pau, our school director Rita Tse and two of our seniors (Witt Qu and Steven Liu) also taught us some knowledge and helped us to solve problems.</p>

	<p>We also had a campus tour during the free time in order to know more about this famous university. The photo was taken in front of the UCLA official mascot. It is a sculpture of a bear which is called Bruin.</p>
