	<p>During the days in Los Angeles, we went sightseeing after our working time. We went to Santa Monica State Beach to watch the sunset. The view is really beautiful! Besides, we also went to Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and Griffith Observatory. Both of them could enrich our knowledge. On the last two days in Los Angeles, we went out for entertainment. We went to Legoland California Resort and Universal Studio Hollywood. We stayed in those fairs almost all day and tried different kinds of recreation equipment.</p>
	<p>The following photos were taken at that time.</p>
