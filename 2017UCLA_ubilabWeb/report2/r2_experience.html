	<p>It's our honor to be chosen to this summer exchange program. All of us hadn't been to the USA before, so it's a good chance for us to broaden our horizon and learn something new. </p>
	<p>Honestly, the UCLA campus is wonderful and unforgettable, and here was where we worked. It's our first time to deal with "big data". It really cost us a lot of time to process those images by using our PC. At the same time, we learnt how the Tensor-Flow works, how the machine recognized images, and how valuable the big data is. We've encountered some problem and finally we solved these problem with our teamwork. At the end, the result is pretty good and useful, we realize that the "big data" field has huge potential, and we will always stay hungry and stay foolish.</<p>
